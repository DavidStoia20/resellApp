# resellApp
This is a small online store project built with React for the front-end and Node.js + MongoDB for the back-end. Users can add products, view them, search for them, and add them to the cart. There's also a pagination system to browse through products and an option to switch between light and dark themes.
Features:
Product Search: Search for products by name.
Pagination: Browse through a list of products with pagination.
Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark modes for better user experience.
Add Products: Admin users can add new products to the database.
Cart: Users can add items to their cart (yet to be implemented for full functionality).
